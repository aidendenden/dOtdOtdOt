Scripts Options: Inspector Tab

In the inspector tab, each script has a number of customizable options...



UIController

Ignore Text Box:
If the script's raycast hits a text box, it will select the object behind it. Default is on.

Every Frame:
The script will perform a raycast every frame. Must be on to use custom cursors or to passively bring objects to front when the cursor is over them. Default is off.

Custom Cursor:
Determines if custom cursors will be used. Default is on.

Normal/Move/Horizontal/Vertical/(etc.) Cursor:
Assigns the images for the specific cursors. If a specific cursor is not assigned, it will use the assigned "normal" custom cursor. If there is no assigned "normal" custom cursor, the default "null" cursor will be used.

X/Y Hotspot Normal/Move/Hor/Vert/(etc.):
Sets the hotspot for the specific cursor on the specific axis. A 0,0 hotspot coresponds to the top left corner of the cursor image. Higher values move the hotspot to the right and downward. Default is 0.
